Get startet with rahanji.

Rahanji is a 'modern' and not really mature functional and dynamic typed  programming language. Its designed, because I wanted to create my own programming language.
Rahanji has a hard syntax due to mayby cryptic keywords, making the programmer use his brain.
Its semantic is quite easy because its just executed from top to bottom. 
Two advantages are the low learning curve (because it doesn't really have that many features) and the portability.
It runs on every OS having a high enough java version installed.
